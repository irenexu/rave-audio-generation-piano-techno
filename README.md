# Rave-Audio-Generation-Piano-Techno README


## Overview

This repository contains the code and datasets, and resources for the work submitted for AI for Media Course at CCI, UAL.

The project focuses on exploring audio generation and real-time latent space manipulation with Real-time Audio Variational autoEncoder (https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE), which was released by Caillon and Esling (ACIDS IRCAM) in 2021.

The code in this repo was written all in Python, with Max/MSP used in real-time latent space manipulation, and Dorothy (https://github.com/Louismac/dorothy/, Copyright (c) 2023 Louismac) used in audio visulisation.

It is recommended to download Max/Msp and NN~ to access the .maxpat files included in this project; otherwise, demo videos are included for viewing.

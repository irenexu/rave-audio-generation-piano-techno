# AI-4-Media-Rave-Audio-Generation


## Overview

This repository contains the code, datasets, and resources for AI for Media Course at CCI. All files are available on GitHub at https://git.arts.ac.uk/23001934/AI-4-Media-Rave-Audio-Generation

The project focuses on exploring audio generation and real-time latent space manipulation with Real-time Audio Variational autoEncoder (https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE), which was released by Caillon and Esling (ACIDS IRCAM) in 2021.

The code in this repo was written all in Python, with Max/MSP used in real-time latent space manipulation, and Dorothy (https://github.com/Louismac/dorothy/, Copyright (c) 2023 Louismac) used in audio visulisation.

It is recommended to download Max/Msp and NN~ to access the .maxpat files included in this project; otherwise, demo videos are included for viewing.


## Instructions

Please follow the Jupyter Notebooks in order to navigate through all the files. Note that due to GitHub's file size limitations, some essential files and models were removed and must be downloaded using the provided code and links.

All audio files included in this project are copyright-free audio obtained online. 

This repo can be used on the providing datasets or any new datasets based on instructions included in notebooks.

In case of any missing files or expired download links, please reach out to the repository owner - Irene Xu at i.xu0320231@arts.ac.uk or irenex1724@gmail.com.


## Disclaimer

ChatGPT has been used in this project for some proofreading, code debugging, as well as for searching certain Python codes and model training issues which have not been covered in class. Comments have been added to the notebook where ChatGPT and external resources (such as stackoverflow post and discord discussion) was used. Some code was adapted from lecture notebooks, with modifications made to tailor it to the project and the dataset used.
